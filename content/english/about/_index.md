intro: "<p><i>Hi! I'm Julija, and I absolutely love diving deep into the world of design to make user experiences as delightful as possible. Each day is a new adventure for me; I'm constantly picking up new skills and insights to ensure I'm always bringing my A-game.</i></p>

<p>My journey has taken me through the realms of product management and design, where I've found that these two areas blend beautifully together. I've enriched my understanding of UI/UX and product design by participating in workshops, celebrating new certifications, soaking up knowledge from blogs, and applying what I've learned directly to real-world projects. I've come to see that the world of UI/UX is boundless, and staying sharp means being perpetually curious—whether that's tuning into the latest podcast or jumping into a fresh course. </p>

At heart, I'm someone who sees the bigger picture and loves figuring out how each detail fits into the grand scheme of things. Yet, I'm also a stickler for details—yes, I'm that person who thinks every single pixel plays a pivotal role!"
