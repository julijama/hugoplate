intro: "<p><i>Hey there, I'm Julija! Product design isn't just a job for me—it's my passion.</i></p>

<p>My journey from <font color='blue'>product management</font> to <font color='blue'>UI/UX design</font> has been quite the adventure, shaping me into the designer I am today. I'm obsessed with the little things, ensuring <font color='blue'>every pixel tells a story</font> in the user experience. However, I <font color='blue'>focus on the big picture</font> to make sure the project meets user needs by aligning with strategy, prioritizing tasks, and using resources efficiently.</p>

<p>Leveraging my background in <font color='blue'>product management</font>, I aim to create designs that not only look good but also align with <font color='blue'>user needs and business goals</font>. What excites me most is crafting interfaces that users love to engage with.</p>

So, that's who I am: passionate about product design, merging creativity with strategy to craft <font color='blue'>user-friendly experiences</font>. When I'm not immersed in product creation, you'll find me behind the lens capturing moments or hiking in the mountains."
