#### Experience

**UI/UX Design**
As a Product Designer, I've developed intuitive UIs focused on privacy and user experience, leveraging Figma, Sketch, and Miro to transform user data into actionable design improvements. My work, including wireframes and UI prototypes, has boosted user satisfaction, retention by 30%, and daily engagement. Rigorous usability testing further enhanced designs, reducing churn by 25% and increasing conversions by 40%, underlining the significant impact of strategic UI/UX design on product success.

**Product Management**
As a Product Manager, I've spearheaded strategy and innovation across key sectors like digital security and banking, notably with SignD Identity GmbH and Raiffeisen Bank International. My efforts in introducing critical KYC/KYB features led to a 40% surge in user acquisition and 25% more sales at SignD. At Raiffeisen, I enhanced project efficiency by 15%, leveraging advanced project management and data analysis. Freelance consulting allowed me to boost UI/UX engagement by 20%. My knack for leading complex projects and fostering teamwork has consistently generated pioneering solutions, boosting user experience and market position.
